In my previous post we learnt how to deploy a local kubernetes cluster for deveopment purpose. In this topic we will create a production grade kubernetes cluster. For a production like kubernetes cluster we need to make sure that it's highly available. In this post we will create a high available kubernetes cluster using haproxy, keepalived for load balancer and k3s tool for kubernetes cluster.  

# Cluster Architechture

Here will will create the cluster with 3 masters and three worker nodes, two nodes for load balancing and one virtual IP address. The virtual IP address in this example may also be called "a floating IP address". That means in the event of node failures, the IP address can be passed between nodes allowing for failover, thus achieving high availability.

## VM Requirements

| Sl. No. | Host Name                  | IP Address    | Role           |
| :------: | :------------------------ | :-----------: | :----------    |
|  1      | kube-controller-server-1   | 172.16.5.185  |  Master        |
|  2      | kube-controller-server-2   | 172.16.5.186  |  Master        |
|  3      | kube-controller-server-3   | 172.16.5.187  |  Master        |
|  4      | kube-worker-server-1       | 172.16.5.188  |  Worker        |                      
|  5      | kube-worker-server-2       | 172.16.5.189  |  Worker        |
|  6      | kube-worker-server-3       | 172.16.5.190  |  Worker        |
|  7      | kube-lb-server-1           | 172.16.5.191  |  Load Balancer |
|  8      | kube-lb-server-2           | 172.16.5.192  |  Load Balancer |
|  9      | VIP                        | 172.16.5.193  |  Virtual IP    |

# Prepare the VM's for Load balancer

Two VM's will be configured as load balancer and will be placed in front of Kubernetes Master VM's to route the traffic based on the availability. Load balancer will make sure to send the traffic if the master node is up and running to maintain the high availability of the master nodes. 

## Upgrade the system

Execute the below command to update and upgrade the system. 

```
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y 
```
## Install haproxy and keepalived for load balancing and high availability.

Execute the below command to install keepalived and haproxy

```
apt install keepalived haproxy 
systemctl restart haproxy
```

### Configure IP forwarding and non-local binding

To enable Keepalived service to forward network packets to the backend servers, you need to enable IP forwarding. Run this command on both HAProxy servers;

```
sed -i 's/#net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/net.ipv4.ip_forward=1/' /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Similarly, you need to enable HAProxy and Keepalived to bind to non-local IP address, that is to bind to the failover IP address (Floating IP).

```
echo "net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind = 1" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Reload sysctl settings;

```
sysctl -p
```

### Configure haproxy 

The configuration of HAproxy is exactly the same on the two machines for load balancing. Run the following command to configure HAproxy.

```
vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
```

Here is an example configuration for your reference (Pay attention to the server field. Note that 6443 is the apiserver port):

```
global
    log /dev/log  local0 warning
    chroot      /var/lib/haproxy
    pidfile     /var/run/haproxy.pid
    maxconn     4000
    user        haproxy
    group       haproxy
    daemon
   
   stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats
   
defaults
  log global
  option  httplog
  option  dontlognull
        timeout connect 5000
        timeout client 50000
        timeout server 50000
   
frontend kube-apiserver
  bind *:6443
  mode tcp
  option tcplog
  default_backend kube-apiserver
   
backend kube-apiserver
    mode tcp
    option tcplog
    option tcp-check
    balance roundrobin
    default-server inter 10s downinter 5s rise 2 fall 2 slowstart 60s maxconn 250 maxqueue 256 weight 100
    server kube-controller-server-1 172.16.5.185:6443 check # Replace the IP address with your own.
    server kube-controller-server-2 172.16.5.186:6443 check # Replace the IP address with your own.
    server kube-controller-server-3 172.16.5.187:6443 check # Replace the IP address with your own.
```

Save the file and run the following command to restart HAproxy.

```
systemctl restart haproxy
```

Make it persist through reboots:

```
systemctl enable haproxy
```
Make sure to configure the LB on the other VM as well.

### Keepalived Configuration

Keepalived must be installed on both machines while the configuration of them is slightly different.

Run the following command to configure Keepalived.

```
vi /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
```

Here is an example configuration (lb1) for your reference:

```
global_defs {
  notification_email {
  }
  router_id LVS_DEVEL
  vrrp_skip_check_adv_addr
  vrrp_garp_interval 0
  vrrp_gna_interval 0
}
   
vrrp_script chk_haproxy {
  script "killall -0 haproxy"
  interval 2
  weight 2
}
   
vrrp_instance haproxy-vip {
  state BACKUP
  priority 100
  interface eth0                       # Network card name; excute `ip add` to get the name of the interface
  virtual_router_id 60
  advert_int 1
  authentication {
    auth_type PASS
    auth_pass 1111
  }
  unicast_src_ip 172.16.5.192      # The IP address of this machine
  unicast_peer {
    172.16.5.191                         # The IP address of peer machines
  }
   
  virtual_ipaddress {
    172.16.5.193/22                  # The VIP address
  }
   
  track_script {
    chk_haproxy
  }
}
```

# Install k3s and start the Kubernetes cluster

To configure high availability for k3s it's recomendated to have an odd number of servers for master nodes. In this post we will configure the masters with 3 VM's. 

## Prepare the Master nodes and add to Cluster

To get started, first launch a server node with the `--cluster-init` flag to enable clustering, `--node-taint` flag will be used to not to run any workload on the master nodes and `--tls-san` flag to pass the virtual IP information to added in the certificates. 

Execute the below command on the first Master node

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --cluster-init --node-taint CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute --tls-san 172.16.5.193
```

Upon a successful exection of the above command you will be able to see the output like this:

```
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-1:~$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server --cluster-init --node-taint CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute --tls-san 172.16.5.193

[INFO]  systemd: Starting k3s
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-1:~$

```

After adding the first master node to our cluster now it's time add other master nodes to our cluster. To add the rest of the master node to our cluster we need the server token from the first master node. To Get the server token execute the below command on the first master node:

```
cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/token
```

Now we have our server token that we will use in the below command for the value of the environment variable `K3S_TOKEN`. Please replace the value of yours. Execute the below command on rest of the master nodes:

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN=K109b14fddfed986e06601e8c78532e7ec08f503d90209deb751caab1e4f98bf9d0::server:1070d4b8ab8bde36932c7c86128a8e40 sh -s - server --server https://172.16.5.193:6443 --node-taint CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute --tls-san 172.16.5.193
```

Output of the above command will be: 

```
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-2:~$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_TOKEN=K109b14fddfed986e06601e8c78532e7ec08f503d90209deb751caab1e4f98bf9d0::server:1070d4b8ab8bde36932c7c86128a8e40 sh -s - server --server https://172.16.5.193:6443 --node-taint CriticalAddonsOnly=true:NoExecute --tls-san 172.16.5.193

```
## Interact with your cluster

By this time we have added all of our master nodes to our cluster. Now it's time to check it using `kubectl` cli command. `k3s` tool will install the `kubectl` command line tool by default on all of the master nodes. Let's execute the below command to get the node status:

```
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-3:~$ sudo kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES                       AGE   VERSION
kube-controller-server-1   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   72m   v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-controller-server-2   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   14m   v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-controller-server-3   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   8m    v1.23.8+k3s2
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-3:~$
```

You can see in the above output that we have now 3 master nodes added to our kubernetes cluster. 

## Prepare Agent nodes and add them to the cluster

Now it's time to add the agent nodes to the kubernets cluster; after adding all the master nodes. To add the agent nodes we need the token from any of the above master nodes. To get the agent token execute the below command on any of the master:  

```
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

Execute the command to add the node to the cluster:

```
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://172.16.5.193:6443 K3S_TOKEN=K109b14fddfed986e06601e8c78532e7ec08f503d90209deb751caab1e4f98bf9d0::server:1070d4b8ab8bde36932c7c86128a8e40 sh -
```

Once you are done adding all the worker nodes you can execute the below command to check / validate our cluster status. 

```
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-1:~$ sudo k3s kubectl get nodes
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
kube-controller-server-1   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   120m    v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-controller-server-2   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   61m     v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-controller-server-3   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   55m     v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-worker-server-1       Ready    <none>                      32m     v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-worker-server-2       Ready    <none>                      5m58s   v1.23.8+k3s2
kube-worker-server-3       Ready    <none>                      16s     v1.23.8+k3s2
ubuntu@kube-controller-server-1:~$
```

As you can see in the above output, that we have now all the master nodes and agent nodes connected to our cluster. Now it's time to test our cluster by deploying an application. Let's deploy a sample application to our newly created cluster to validate everything is working as expected. For the validation purpose we will deploy a nginx webserver and we will use metalb as the load balancer.

## Cluster Validation

Deploy the sample application by following the below steps:

### Step 1 : Install MetalLB

Install MetalLB using the official manifests by MetalLB

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.10.2/manifests/namespace.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.10.2/manifests/metallb.yaml
```

### Step 2 : Create ConfigMap for MetalLB

Next you need to create ConfigMap, which includes an IP address range for the load balancer. The pool of IPs must be dedicated to MetalLB's use. Create the ConfigMap named `metallb-configmap.yaml` and deploy it using the command `kubectl apply -f metallb-configmap.yaml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - <ip-address-range-start>-<ip-address-range-stop>
```

### Step 3 : Deploy an example application (web server) with a load balancer

Create a deployment file named `web_lb.yaml` with below content and deploy it using command `kubectl apply -f web_lb.yaml`

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: web
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-server
  namespace: web
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: httpd
        image: httpd:2.4.48-alpine3.14
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web-server-service
  namespace: web
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer

```

### Step 4 : Check your LoadBalancer

Run the following command to see your LoadBalancer with the external-ip and port.

```
kubectl get service -n web
```

### Step 5 : Access your example application

Now access the Private IP in your web browser and you should be able to see `It works!` page.
